      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This specification defines segment formats for implementations of [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] [[MEDIA-SOURCE]] that choose to support the ISO Base Media File Format [[ISOBMFF]].</p>
      <p>It defines the MIME-type parameters used to signal codecs, and provides
      the necessary format specific definitions for [=initialization segments=], [=media segments=], and [=random access points=] required by
      the <a data-cite="media-source#byte-stream-formats">Byte Stream Formats section</a> of the [[[MEDIA-SOURCE]]] specification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mime-parameters">
      <h2>MIME-type parameters</h2>
      <p>This section specifies the parameters that can be used in the MIME-type passed to {{MediaSource/isTypeSupported()}} or {{MediaSource/addSourceBuffer()}}.</p>
      <p>MIME-types for this specification MUST conform to the rules outlined for "audio/mp4" and "video/mp4" in [[RFC6381]].
      </p>
      <div class="note">Implementations MAY only implement a subset of the codecs and profiles mentioned in [[RFC6381]].</div>
    </section>

    <section id="iso-init-segments">
      <h4>Initialization Segments</h4>
      <p>An ISO BMFF [=initialization segment=] is defined in this specification as a single File Type Box (<span class="iso-box">ftyp</span>) followed by a single Movie Box (<span class="iso-box">moov</span>).</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A File Type Box contains a <span class="iso-var">major_brand</span> or <span class="iso-var">compatible_brand</span> that the user agent does not support.</li>
        <li>A box or field in the Movie Box is encountered that violates the requirements mandated
          by the <span class="iso-var">major_brand</span> or one of the
          <span class="iso-var">compatible_brands</span> in the File Type Box.</li>
        <li>The tracks in the Movie Box contain samples (i.e., the <span class="iso-var">entry_count</span> in the
          <span class="iso-box">stts</span>, <span class="iso-box">stsc</span> or <span class="iso-box">stco</span> boxes are not set to zero).</li>
        <li>A Movie Extends (<span class="iso-box">mvex</span>) box is not contained in the Movie (<span class="iso-box">moov</span>) box to indicate that Movie Fragments are to be expected.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The user agent MUST support setting the offset from media composition time to movie presentation time by handling an Edit Box (<span class="iso-box">edts</span>) containing a single Edit List Box
        (<span class="iso-box">elst</span>) that contains a single edit with media rate one. This edit MAY have a duration of 0 (indicating that it spans all subsequent media) or MAY have a non-zero duration
        (indicating the total duration of the movie including fragments).</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST support codec configurations stored out-of-band in the sample entry, and for codecs which allow codec configurations stored inband in the samples themselves, the user agent SHOULD support codec configurations stored inband.</p>
      <p class="note">For example, for codecs which include SPS and PPS parameter sets, for maximum content interoperability, user agents are strongly advised to support both inband (e.g., as defined for avc3/avc4) and out-of-band (e.g., as defined for avc1/2) storage of the SPS and PPS.</p>

      <p>Valid top-level boxes such as <span class="iso-box">pdin</span>, <span class="iso-box">free</span>, and <span class="iso-box">sidx</span> are
        allowed to appear before the <span class="iso-box">moov</span> box. These boxes MUST be accepted and ignored by the user agent and are not
        considered part of the [=initialization segment=] in this specification.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST source attribute values for `id`, `kind`, `label` and `language` for {{AudioTrack}}, {{VideoTrack}} and
        {{TextTrack}} objects as described for MPEG-4 ISOBMFF in the in-band tracks spec [[INBANDTRACKS]].</p>
    </section>

    <section id="iso-media-segments">
      <h4>Media Segments</h4>
      <p>An ISO BMFF [=media segment=] is defined in this specification as one optional
        Segment Type Box (<span class="iso-box">styp</span>) followed by a single Movie Fragment Box
        (<span class="iso-box">moof</span>) followed by one or more Media Data Boxes (<span class="iso-box">mdat</span>).
        If the Segment Type Box is not present, the segment MUST conform to the brands listed in the
        File Type Box (<span class="iso-box">ftyp</span>) in the [=initialization segment=].</p>
      <p>Valid top-level boxes defined in [[ISOBMFF]] other than <span class="iso-box">ftyp</span>,
        <span class="iso-box">moov</span>, <span class="iso-box">styp</span>, <span class="iso-box">moof</span>, and <span class="iso-box">mdat</span> are allowed to appear between the end of an
        [=initialization segment=] or [=media segment=] and before the beginning of a new [=media segment=].
        These boxes MUST be accepted and ignored by the user agent and are not considered part of the [=media segment=] in this
        specification.
      </p>

      <p>The user agent MUST run the [=append error=] algorithm if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A box or field in the Movie Fragment Box is encountered that violates the requirements mandated
          by the <span class="iso-var">major_brand</span> or one of the
          <span class="iso-var">compatible_brands</span> in the Segment Type Box in this
          [=media segment=] or the File Type Box in the [=initialization segment=] if a
          Segment Type Box is not present.</li>
        <li>This [=media segment=] contains a Segment Type Box that is not compatible with the
          File Type Box in the [=initialization segment=].</li>
  <li>The Movie Fragment Box does not contain at least one Track Fragment Box (<span class="iso-box">traf</span>).</li>
  <li>The Movie Fragment Box does not use <a>movie-fragment relative addressing</a>.</li>
  <li>External data references are being used.</li>
  <li>At least one Track Fragment Box does not contain a Track Fragment Decode Time Box (<span class="iso-box">tfdt</span>)</li>
  <li>The Media Data Boxes do not contain all the samples referenced by the Track Fragment Run Boxes (<span class="iso-box">trun</span>) of the Movie Fragment Box.</li>
  <li>Inband parameter sets are not present in the appropriate samples and parameter sets are not present in the last initialization segment appended.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A Movie Fragment Box uses <dfn>movie-fragment relative addressing</dfn>
        when the first Track Fragment Run(<span class="iso-box">trun</span>) box in each Track Fragment Box
        has the <span class="iso-var">data-offset-present</span> flag set and either of the following
        conditions are met:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every Track Fragment Box in a Movie Fragment Box has the <span class="iso-var">default-base-is-moof</span> flag set.
          <p class="note">This implies that the <span class="iso-var">base-data-offset-present</span> flag
            is not set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Movie Fragment Box contains a single Track Fragment Box and that box does not have the <span class="iso-var">base-data-offset-present</span> flag set.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="iso-random-access-points">
      <h4>Random Access Points</h4>
      <p>A [=random access point=] as defined in this specification corresponds to a Stream Access Point of type 1 or 2 as defined in Annex I of [[ISOBMFF]].</p>
